Description: Package provides some code to run simulations of state-space models, and then
    use these in the Approximate Bayesian Computation Sequential Monte Carlo (ABC-SMC) 
    algorithm, and a bootstrap particle filter based particle Markov Chain Monte Carlo 
    (PMCMC) algorithm. Also provides functions to plot and summarise the outputs.
