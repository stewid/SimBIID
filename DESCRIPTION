Description: Package provides some code to run simulations of state-space models, and then
    use these in the ABC-SMC algorithm of Toni et al. (2009) and the bootstrap particle
    filter based particle MCMC algorithm (Andrieu et al., 2010). Also provides functions
    to plot and summarise the outputs.
